Get farther, quicker by using technologies that kerbals never thought to use!

 You'll be surprised how useful old technology really is for the space program

While of course you could use the parts supplied specifically for the space program, you can get farther, quicker, by using utilities that have a history of versatility.

This pack includes some parts to kick start your exploration of the Kerbol system.
