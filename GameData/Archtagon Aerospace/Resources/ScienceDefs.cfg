                               KerbinInSpaceLow = The sensors confirm the existence of micrometeorites, either that or we just got hit by a decoupler bolt.
                               KerbinInSpaceHigh = The frequency has diminished significantly since ascending to a higher orbit.
                               KerbinSrfLanded = The sensor reads absolutely nothing, as if we weren't in space at all.
							   KerbinSrfSplashedWater = The sensor has rusted and probably won't work again.
                               MunInSpaceHigh = It seems the region between Kerbin and the Mun is quite clear of any particles.
                               MunInSpaceLow = The readings are lower than expected, seems that the surface of the Mun has been bombarded over a much longer period of time than predicted.
                               MunSrf = Very little has been detected, a sigh of relief for our engineers. Shielding might be useful for longer term missions, however.
                               MinmusInSpaceLow = The sensor returns little to no data at the current moment.
                               MinmusInSpaceHigh = The sensor returns little to no data at the current moment.
                               MinmusSrf = The only detected dust came from the lander impacting the surface, other than that it's devoid.

	RESULTS

				               KerbinInSpaceLow = The radiation is quite high here, and it seems to be coming from the sun.
                               KerbinInSpaceHigh = The sensor has either overloaded or has broken, either way the radiation has taken a toll on the spacecraft.
                               KerbinSrfLanded = According to the sensor it is quite sunny, you consider putting on sunscreen.
							   KerbinSrfSplashedWater = It is a nice and breezy tropical day in the ocean.
                               MunInSpaceHigh = More radiation than normal is detected, something must be shielding Kerbin.
                               MunInSpaceLow = It seems the Mun is not so fortunate to have a strong magnetic field to protect itself, sad isn't it?
                               MunSrf = The solar wind would have dragged away any atmosphere is the Mun ever had one.
                               MinmusInSpaceLow = Looks like no protective magnetic field either, slightly dissapointing.
                               MinmusInSpaceHigh = Not much interesting data here, we should get closer.
                               MinmusSrf = No new data, time to carry on.

                               KerbinSrfSplashedWater = The water seeps in to the film scanner and soaks the film in salty sea water.
                               KerbinInSpaceLow = The curvature of Kerbin is very much visible when the camera is facing the horizon.
                               KerbinInSpaceHigh = From this altitude Kerbin appears as nothing more than a green and blue sphere.
                               MunInSpaceHigh = The Mun appears only as a few sparkly pixels at this altitude.
                               MunInSpaceLow = Along with some other images, we have the first image of the backside, exciting!
							   MunSrf = You get a lovely panorama of the Munscape, even if the features leave a lot to be desired.
							   MinmusInSpaceLow = It looks like a frosted snowball.
                               MinmusInSpaceHigh = We've got our first close look at our minty-fresh moon.
                               MinmusSrf = We hoped to see the landscape but unfortunately the lens has frosted over.

                   KerbinSrfSplashedWater = We should pick the probe up before seagulls start pecking at it.
				   KerbinFlyingLow = We noticed that the waves have slightly changed in frequency, possibly due to increased velocity.
				   KerbinFlyingHigh = The radio waves are scrambled and make transmission difficult, but not impossible.
				   KerbinInSpaceLow = The steadily beeping probe is functioning normally.
                   KerbinInSpaceHigh = There seems to be a slight delay between the communications.
